The Introduction

     When you meet with me, King Stephen, I tell you that the
quest to kill Lord Ardradd is a very tough quest if you are a
wizard but it is more easier to finish this quest if you are a
warrior.  I then gave you two riddles that reveal the location of
Lord Ardradd.




               His brain, his breath,
               His body whole,
               To the Lava Sea,
               Is where you must go.

               Up north passed Doughnut Isle,
               Surrounded by mountains is this mystic tile,
               Goith forth, on top you must be,
               And there a path to the Lava Sea.
